This project implements a movie recommendation system using Python, NumPy, and Pandas. 
The system is designed to recommend movies to users based on the content of movies (genres, keywords, cast, crew) and uses cosine similarity for the recommendation.
The project uses two CSV files for movie information:
1. movies.csv: General information about movies.
2. credits.csv: Information about movie credits, including cast and crew details.
